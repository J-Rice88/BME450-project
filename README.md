Project Description
    This project will create a virtual game environment of a random maze and train a Neural Network to solve the maze. The Model will have to traverse the maze earning rewards for going in the right direction and reaching the goal. There will be a key, at another location in the maze that the model will have to collect first before reaching the end. We will adjust the rewards, the learning rate, and other essential parameters of the mdel to potimally solve the maze.
