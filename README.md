Project Description
    This project will take a stream of neural data and will isolate the waveforms of neural spikes. These waveforms, recorded in strings of data between 20 - 30 points long, will then be fed into the neural network that will determine which neuron each waveform belongs to. The dataset used is a simualted Neural response with 3 neurons. For training of the dataset, we will manually perform spike sorting on the dataset to determine the "correct" answers for the training of the network.
